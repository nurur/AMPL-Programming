AMPL-Programming
================
This repository contains codes implemented in AMPL (A Mathematical Programming 
Language). AMPL is a algebraic programming language widely used in Operations 
Research. The codes highlights linear programming (e.g. staff scheduling, 
operation planning), non-linear programming (e.g. location-allocation, portfolio 
optimization), integer programming (e.g. capital budgeting, facility location), 
and mixed-integer programming (e.g. staff assignment, constrained portfolio 
optimization). 

Most of these AMPL codes are written during the MS degree in Business Analytics.
Some of these codes are borrowed directly from various authors for learning purposes.
