AMPL-Programming
================
This repository contains codes implemented in AMPL (A Mathematical Programming 
Language). AMPL is a algebraic programming language widely used in Operation 
Research. The codes highlights linear programming (e.g. staff scheduling, 
operation planning), non-linear programming (e.g. location-allocation, portfolio 
optimization), integer programming (e.g. capital budgeting, facility location), 
and mixed-integer programming (e.g. staff assignment, constrained portfolio 
optimization). 

I learned the techniques of AMPL programming during the MS degree in 
Business Analytics.
